# The Zombono BSP Compiler

A fork of [q2tools-220](https://github.com/qbism/q2tools-220) for Zombono's engine. 

The map format - ZBSP, currently on version 2 - uses a modified version of the Qbism format with even more limits removed and other Zombono-specific changes.

**This compiler cannot be used to compile Quake 2 maps. All Quake 2 map formats have been removed from the compiler.**

GitHub Actions is currently broken, I'm working on it.

# Enhancements:

-bsp

*   Caulk brushes similar to Q3 mapping (kmbsp3)	
*   Set chop size for surface lights (qbism - idea from JDolan)
*   Fix so SURF_NODRAW flagged faces are not included in texture processing. (Paril)
*   Feature: set CONTENTS_AUX flag with CONTENTS_MIST to disable rendering of mist backfaces.

*   Increased texture name size limit from 32 to 80 characters

-vis

*   Keep emit_surface active for sky planes when sun is active. Adjust with -sunradscale. (qbism)
*   Use any existing TGA replacement textures for radiosity (AA tools)
*   Spotlight center to surface point attenuation (AA tools)

    *   moddir is parent of whatever directory contains the .map/.bsp
    *   basedir is moddir unless set explicitly
    *   gamedir is parent of moddir
    *   qdir is parent of gamedir	
	
-data
*	LWO support (KDT)

Directory commands (applies to all tools)
*   -moddir:  Set a mod directory.  Default is parent directory of the map file.
*   -basedir: Set the base data directory for assets not found in moddir.  Default is moddir.
*   -gamedir: Set game directory, the folder with game executable.  Default is parent of basedir.

Based on an example provided by aapokaapo:
My editor is in C:/Games/Trenchbroom/
My '.map'-files are in C:/Games/Trenchbroom/maps
My compilers are in C:/Games/Trenchbroom/tools/
My game/modfiles are in C:/Games/Paintball2/pball/ (my baseq2 dir)

../Trenchbroom/tools/zbsp-rad -basedir C:/Games/Paintball2/pball -gamedir C:/Games/Paintball2 ../Trenchbroom/maps/mymap
=> Compiler finds all the game files and compiles the map correctly


# Notes:

bsp
*   v220 (Valve) support: Trenchbroom and JACK editors can open and save a hybrid format that preserves texture flags.
*   chop:  Usually, higher is better and faster.  Start at 1024 and work down if any issues.  
*   choplight: Set the chop size independetly for surface lights.  Lower settings may improve quality of large surface lights when chop is high. Try "choplight 16".
*   -largebounds: Increase max map size for supporting engines.
*   -moreents: Increase max number of entities for supporting engines.

vis
*   It works the same as always. -fast for a quick single pass.

rad
*   -smooth sets the angle (in degrees) for autophong. Applies to convex and concave corners. Corners between (angle) and (180-angle) will not be phonged.  Default is 44, so it will phong a 9-sided or more prism, but not 8-sided.  Set to zero to disable.
*   -maxmapdata sets lightng memory limit.  Original is 0x200000 and it can be set up to 0x800000 (8388608).  Requires an engine that supports the higher limit.
*	-saturation applies to light reflected from surfaces.  Values < 1.0 desaturate.  Values >1.0 oversaturate. 
*   Any tga replacement textures found will be used for radiosity.
*   -sunradscale sets sky radiosity scale when the sun (directional lighting) is active.  Default is 0.5.
*   -nudge sets the fractional distance from face center when extra lighting samples are used (-extra).  Default is 0.25.
*   _falloff property values; intensity - distance), 1 (inverse; intensity/distance), 2 (inverse-square; intensity/dist*dist)  default: 0  Note that inverse and inverse-square falloff require very high brightness values to be visible.

data
**DATA IS LARGELY DEPRECATED IN ZBSP, EXCEPT FOR ANIMATION CONVERSION - THE REST OF THE FUNCTIONALITY MAY BE REMOVED IN A FUTURE VERSION OF ZBSP**

*   Runs a script file to convert assets to Q2 data types.  This example creates the colormap:
    
    $load base/pics/pal.pcx
	$colormap colormap 

Compile a model from individual .tri, .3ds, or .lwo frames. Example:
    $cd monsters/berserk
    $origin 0 0 24
    $base base
    $skin skin
    $skin pain

    //idle
    $frame stand1 stand2 stand3 stand4 stand5
    $frame standb1 standb2 standb3 standb4 standb5 standb6 standb7 standb8 standb9 standb10
    $frame standb11 standb12 standb13 standb14 standb15 standb16 standb17 standb18 standb19 standb20

    //walk
    //$frame walk1 walk2 walk3 walk4 walk5 walk6 walk7 walk8 walk9 walk10
    ...etc.

# Build from source on Windows.
MinGW is recommended, requiring the mingw-w64, mingw-w64-i686-dev, gcc-multilib, and libz-mingw-w64-dev packages.  

However, you can also use the provided Visual Studio Solution file to build using Microsoft Visual C++, if you wish to do so.

# Build from source in Linux:
Linux-  
mkdir build  
cd build  
Build_GCC<Config>_Linux.sh

Testing Windows in Linux with wine if default is 32-bit:  
WINEARCH=win64 WINEPREFIX=~/64bitprefix wine q2tool.exe
